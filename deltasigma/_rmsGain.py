    The computation is carried out over the frequency band ``(f1, f2)``,

    **Parameters:**

    H : object
        The discrete-time transfer function. See  :func:`evalTF` for the supported types.

    f1 : scalar
        The start value in Hertz of the frequency band over which the gain is evaluated.

    f2 : scalar
        The end value (inclusive) in Hertz of the aforementioned frequency band.

    N : integer, optional
        The number of discretization points to be taken over specified interval.

    **Returns:**

    Grms : scalar
        The root mean-square gain
