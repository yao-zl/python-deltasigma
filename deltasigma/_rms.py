    The Root Mean Square value of an array :math:`x` of length :math:`n` is defined as:

    .. math::

        x_{RMS} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}(x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ...+x_n^2)}

    x : (N,) ndarray
        The input vector

    no_dc : boolean, optional
        If set to ``True``, the DC value gets subtracted from ``x`` first and the RMS is computed on the result.

    **Returns:**

    xrms : scalar
        as defined above
