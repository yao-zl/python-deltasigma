def synthesizeNTF(order=3, osr=64, opt=0, H_inf=1.5, f0=0.0):
    """Synthesize a noise transfer function for a delta-sigma modulator.

    **Parameters:**

    order : int, optional
        the order of the modulator, defaults to 3.
    osr : float, optional
        the oversampling ratio, defaults to 64.
    opt : int or list of floats, optional
        flag to select which algorithm is to be used to place the zeros,
        defaults to 0.

        * 0 -> not optimized,
        * 1 -> optimized,
        * 2 -> optimized with at least one zero at band-center,
        * 3 -> optimized zeros (with optimizer)
        * 4 -> same as 3, but with at least one zero at band-center
        * [z] -> zero locations in complex form

    H_inf : float, optional
        maximum allowed value of the absolute value of the NTF. Defaults to 1.5.
    f0 : float, optional
        center frequency for band-pass modulators, or 0 for low-pass modulators.
        Defaults to 0.
        The frequency is normalized throughout the ``deltasigma`` package. The
        normalization is: 1 corresponds to the sampling frequency. Therefore 0.5
        is the maximum value that can be assigned to ``f0``.

    **Returns:**

    ntf : tuple
        noise transfer function in zpk form.

    **Raises:**

    ValueError
        * 'Error. ``f0`` must be less than 0.5', if ``f0`` is out of range.

        * 'Order must be even for a bandpass modulator.' if the order is
          odd and therefore incompatible with the modulator type.

        * 'The ``opt`` vector must be of length xxx' if ``opt`` is used to
          explicitly pass the NTF zeros and these are in the wrong number.

    **Warns:**

        * 'Creating a low-pass NTF.', if the center frequency is different
          from zero, but so close to 0 that a low-pass modulator must be
          designed.

        * 'Unable to achieve specified ``H_inf`` ...', if the desired ``H_inf``
          cannot be achieved.

        * 'Iteration limit exceeded', if the routine converges too slowly.

    **Notes:**

    This is actually a wrapper function which calls the appropriate version of
    ``synthesizeNTF``, based on the module control flag ``optimize_NTF`` which
    determines whether to use optimization tools.

    The parameter ``H_inf`` is used to enforce the Lee stability criterion.

    **Example:**

    Fifth-order low-pass modulator; zeros optimized for an oversampling ratio of 32.::

        from deltasigma import *
        H = synthesizeNTF(5, 32, 1)
        pretty_lti(H)

    Returns::

              (z -1) (z^2 -1.997z +1) (z^2 -1.992z +0.9999)
        --------------------------------------------------------
         (z -0.7778) (z^2 -1.796z +0.8549) (z^2 -1.613z +0.665)

    .. plot::

        from deltasigma import *
        H = synthesizeNTF(5, 32, 1)
        DocumentNTF(H, 32)

    .. seealso::

       :func:`clans` : Closed-Loop Analysis of Noise-Shaper.
           An alternative method for selecting NTFs based on the 1-norm of the
           impulse response of the NTF.

       :func:`synthesizeChebyshevNTF()` : Select a type-2 highpass Chebyshev NTF.
           This function does a better job than :func:`synthesizeNTF` if ``osr``
           or ``H_inf`` is low.
